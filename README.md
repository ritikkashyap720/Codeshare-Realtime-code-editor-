## Key Features

- Real-time collaboration: Users can see each other's code changes in real-time, fostering teamwork and knowledge sharing.
- Room creation: Users can create rooms and share unique IDs to invite others, ensuring privacy and exclusivity.
- Multi-language support: Our platform supports code compilation in Python, C++, and Java, catering to diverse coding needs.
- Front-End Coding: Our platform supports coding HTML, CSS, and JS.

## How compilation works

- First code is sent to server, then server generate a file and register a job id with staus pending and this job id is passed to client.
- Then the generated file is compiled if the code have an error the status of job id is updated with status error and output is updated on database if no error then output is updated with status success in the database .
- And on client side after recieving the job id the client will start making polling request on the /status with job id at an interval of 1000ms.
- And if the status change with success or error the polling request is stopped and the output is display on the editor.
